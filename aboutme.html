<p>My name is Dallas Williams and I am a junior at Northwest Missouri State University.<br>
    I play football at Northwest as a corner and punter. I enjoy outdoor activities such as golf, disc golf, hammocking, hicking, swimming, and fishing.<br>
    I am also a huge movie buff. My favorite movies include Good Will Hunting, The Italian Job, and A Few Good Men. <br>
    I also watch a lot of anime and my favorite anime is Steins;Gate. I have three brothers name Brogan, Emmett, and Graham. I am the second oldest.</p>
    <h1>Good Will Hunting</h1>
    <p>Good Will Hunting, in my opinion, is one of the greatest movies made. What makes it so great is challenges that Will has to overcome when trying to straighten <br>
    his life around, and the connection he makes with Sean (his therapist). It has a great story to tell and an even better ending.</p>
